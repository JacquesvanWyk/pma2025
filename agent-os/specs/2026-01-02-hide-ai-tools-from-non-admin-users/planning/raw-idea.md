# Raw Idea: Hide AI Tools from Non-Admin Users

**Feature:** Hide AI Tools from Non-Admin Users

**Description:**
I want to build a feature to hide AI tool pages in the Filament admin dashboard. Currently all users can see AI tools like Image Generator, Music Generator, Video Generator etc. Only the admin user (me) should see these pages. Non-admin users (senior_pastor, pastor, member roles) should not see them in navigation or be able to access them directly.

**Problem it solves:**
- Non-admin users shouldn't have access to AI generation tools
- These are admin-only features that should be hidden from regular users
