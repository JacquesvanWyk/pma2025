We hold to the faith once delivered to the saints, which includes the foundational truths of God's Word, the sanctuary message, the Three Angels' Messages of Revelation 14, the solemnity of the seventh-day Sabbath, and the blessed hope of Christ's soon return.

                                We believe the Holy Bible, comprised of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is the supreme rule of faith and practice, containing all things necessary for salvation and holy living. We affirm the King James Bible as a faithful and trustworthy translation of God's Word.

                                We believe in one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This mystery of the Godhead, while transcending full human comprehension, is clearly revealed in Scripture. God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.

                                We believe in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, who became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary. He lived a sinless life, performed mighty miracles, taught the way of salvation, died on the cross as the atoning sacrifice for our sins, was buried, and rose again the third day. He ascended to heaven and now ministers as our High Priest and Mediator in the heavenly sanctuary.

                                We believe in the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Godhead, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. He convicts of sin, draws souls to Christ, regenerates the heart, indwells the believer, empowers for holy living, and distributes spiritual gifts for the edification of the church.

                                We believe in the literal, six-day creation of the heavens and the earth by the Word of God. We reject theistic evolution and affirm that all life was designed and created by God in six literal days, with God resting on the seventh day and instituting the Sabbath as a memorial of creation.

                                We believe man was created in the image of God, holy and upright. Through the fall of Adam, sin entered the world, and all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Human nature is fallen, and apart from Christ, we are hopelessly lost.

                                We believe in the great controversy between Christ and Satan, between good and evil, which began in heaven and will culminate at the end of time. This conflict involves the whole universe and centers on the character of God, His law, and His government.

                                We believe salvation is the free gift of God's grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ. It involves repentance, confession, and conversion. Christ's righteousness is imputed to the believer, and through the indwelling Spirit, the believer is enabled to live a holy life.

                                We believe in justification by faith, wherein the penitent sinner is pardoned and accepted before God. We also believe in sanctification, the lifelong process of being conformed to the image of Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit.

                                We believe the seventh day of the week (Saturday) is the holy Sabbath of the Lord, a memorial of creation and a sign of sanctification. It was instituted at creation, reaffirmed in the Ten Commandments, and observed by Christ and the apostles. The true Sabbath has never been changed to Sunday.

                                We believe the prophecy of the 2300 days (Daniel 8:14) reached its fulfillment in 1844, marking the beginning of the antitypical Day of Atonement and the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary. This is the time of the investigative judgment and the final phase of Christ's high-priestly ministry.
