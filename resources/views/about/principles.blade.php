                                We believe that the Bible is the sole and final authority for all matters of faith, doctrine, and conduct. It is infallible in its nature, breathed by God, and serves as the perfect revelation of His will for humanity.

                                <li><strong>Psalm 119:105:</strong> "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                We reject the doctrine of the Trinity as an unbiblical construct. We believe that God is one—specifically, that God the Father is the only true God. He is the Source of all existence, the Almighty, and the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.

                                <li><strong>Ephesians 4:6:</strong> "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, begotten of the Father before the worlds were created. He was sent into the world to be the Savior of mankind. As the Son, He is wholly divine, possessing the very nature of God. Through His incarnation, He took upon Himself human nature, becoming the bridge between the Divine and the human.

                                <li><strong>Philippians 2:6-7:</strong> "Who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                We believe the Holy Spirit is not a third separate individual or person. Rather, the term refers to the Spirit of the Father or the Spirit of the Son. "Spirit" (pneuma/ruach) defines breath, life, mind, and presence. It is the means by which the Father and Son dwell within the believer.

                                <li><strong>Matthew 10:20:</strong> "For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."</li>
                                <li><strong>Galatians 4:6:</strong> "And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'"</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                We believe that upon genuine faith and the acceptance of the life of Jesus, a sinner is "born again." This transformation is not an evolutionary process of self-improvement, but an immediate act of creation by God. This is often publicly demonstrated through the act of baptism.

                                <li><strong>John 3:3:</strong> "Jesus answered him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                Salvation and righteousness are gifts of God's grace, attained through faith alone. No amount of human effort or works can earn or contribute to this gift. It is the very righteousness of Christ that is credited to the repentant sinner.
                            </p>

                                <li><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9:</strong> "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."</li>
                                <li><strong>Romans 3:24:</strong> "And are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."</li>
                                <li><strong>Galatians 2:16:</strong> "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ..."</li>

                                We believe the Seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) is the true day of worship. It serves as a memorial of Creation that God accomplished through His Son. Furthermore, it is a day of rest from physical labor, symbolizing the spiritual rest the believer enters when they cease relying on their own works for salvation and rest entirely in Christ.

                                <li><strong>Exodus 20:8-10:</strong> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God."</li>
                                <li><strong>Hebrews 4:9-10:</strong> "So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his."</li>
                                <li><strong>Genesis 2:2-3:</strong> "And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day... So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy."</li>
