                                We believe in one God as a personal, spiritual being, the creator of all things, omnipotent, omniscient, and eternal. God is unchangeable and present everywhere through the Holy Spirit.

                                Christ is the eternal Father's Son and creator of all things. We emphasize His incarnation, exemplary life, sacrificial death, resurrection, and ongoing priestly ministry in heaven's sanctuary where He makes atonement for sins.

                                The Old and New Testaments are inspired Scripture containing God's full revelation and the only infallible rule of faith and practice.

                                Baptism is a Christian ordinance following faith and repentance, commemorating Christ's resurrection through immersion—the only mode properly representing these theological truths.

                                Regeneration comprises moral transformation through conversion and physical transformation at Christ's return, involving resurrection or translation to immortality.

                                Prophecy is essential revelation designed for believers' understanding. World history and empires are outlined in prophetic chains, now all fulfilled except the closing scenes.

                                We reject the "world's conversion and temporal millennium" as false doctrine promoting complacency. Christ's second coming precedes the millennium, not follows it.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                The 1844 mistake involved the nature of the expected event, not its timing. The 2,300-day prophecy (Daniel 8:14) terminated that year, pointing to sanctuary cleansing.

                                The sanctuary of the new covenant is the heavenly tabernacle where Christ serves as High Priest. His work parallels the Jewish priestly system, with cleansing occurring post-1844 through sin removal.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                God's moral requirements remain constant across dispensations, summarily contained in the commandments spoken by Jehovah from Sinai. These laws are immutable and eternal.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                Saturday is the only weekly Sabbath known to the Bible, established before sin entered and continuing in the restored paradise. Human terminology like "Jewish Sabbath" is unscriptural.

                                Reform regarding the fourth commandment will occur among believers before Christ's advent, countering papal attempts to alter God's law.

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                The carnal heart is hostile to God, requiring radical transformation of affections and holy principles through repentance and faith via the Holy Spirit's work.

                                We depend on Christ for justification from past transgressions and for grace enabling acceptable obedience to His law going forward.

                                The Spirit manifests through specific gifts enumerated in 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4, neither superseding Scripture nor replaceable by it. These gifts enable ongoing spiritual understanding and conviction.

                                God's proclamation of Christ's second advent is symbolized by Revelation 14's three messages, with the final message emphasizing law reformation and preparedness.

                                The sanctuary cleansing period coincides with the third message—a time of investigative judgment determining worthiness for resurrection or translation before Christ's appearance.
